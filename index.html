        <p>Hello, my name is Minh Duy Bui, I was born in Vietnam and I moved to the U.S in 2017 and currently live in Rochester. I'm major in Game Design and Development here at RIT and expect to graduate in 2027.
        I play video games in my free time, League of Legend, Valorant, CS:GO/CS2 and other games on Steam are what I play.
        Since video games are biggest passion so it only make sense for me to pursuit a Game Development career. </p>

        <h3><a href = https://people.rit.edu/mmb5049/235/exercise/index.html>Dig Dug Project</a></h3>
        <p>Dig is a project that I work in IGME 235. It is broken up into small pieces of exercise for me to work
            on each week to familiarize my self with all the new contents I learn. It is a small yet very solid
            website that I got a chance to build.</p>

            <h3>Custom 404 Project</h3>
            <a href = https://people.rit.edu/mmb5049/235/error/>Not a 404 Page</a>
            <a href = https://people.rit.edu/mmb5049/235/error/error.html>404 Page</a>
            <a href = https://people.rit.edu/mmb5049/235/auth/myPage.html>Auth Page</a>

            <p>This project helps me learned how the 404 error works on website and how to handle them.
                It also show me a way of how to allow access to someone to a website via RIT authenticator

            <p>
                So far this is the project that I has the most freedom with. I got to design the layout of the images in the 
                projects the way I want to. I also design the color scheme of the project so that it will fit the theme of the game
                I'm writing about. It's a lot more challenge than the other projects but I also have the most fun with this one.
